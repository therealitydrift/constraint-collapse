# Constraint Collapse

Constraint Collapse is a failure mode in which systems continue to operate, optimize, and produce outputs even after the constraints that once grounded them to reality have weakened or disappeared.

The term describes how modern cognitive, institutional, and algorithmic systems can remain stable in appearance while losing corrective pressure, allowing errors, distortions, and misalignment to persist without forcing revision or collapse.
